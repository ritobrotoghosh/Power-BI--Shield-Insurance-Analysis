This limitation is hindering their ability to understand customer demographics, identify trends, and optimize strategies. There is a need for a user-friendly analytics tool that can offer real-time insights, allowing the organization to make informed decisions for sustainable growth.

## Objective

- Identify areas for growth and optimization
- Develop an understanding of customer demographics
